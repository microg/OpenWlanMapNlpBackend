OpenWlanMapNlpBackend
=====================
[UnifiedNlp](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp) backend that uses [OpenWlanMap](http://www.openwlanmap.org/) to resolve user location.

Location calculation is done either online or offline. This can be switched in the settings.
Online calculation of course requires internet connection.
Offline calculation won't use any data, but look up the wifi access points in a database on your sd-card only. 
To generate the database a shell script (gen_openwifimap_db.sh) is included.

To contribute to the OpenWlanMap database you can use the available Android app or upload your "wardriving" data manually [here](https://openwlanmap.org/upload.php?lang=). Don't forget to enable the "Publish own data" in the Android apps settings!
